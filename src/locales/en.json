Now an assistance of Rs 50 per day will be given for each cow. Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma said that cow service is the priority of the government and many important decisions have been taken in the interest of cattle owners and cows in the recently presented budget. Addressing the gratitude meeting organized at the Chief Minister's residence, Chief Minister Sharma said that under the Gopal Credit Card Scheme, interest-free loans will now be provided to 2.5 lakh cowherd families. To make this scheme more simple, stamp duty has been waived on all necessary documents.<br/>Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajan Lal Sharma has outlined the government‚Äôs vision to transform the state into not just an agricultural hub but also India‚Äôs largest dairy hub. Speaking at the Gau Mahakumbh, a global summit on cows, organised by the Shri Devraha Baba Gau Seva Parivar in Jaipur yesterday, the Chief Minister highlighted the significant steps being taken to achieve this goal.<br/>A provision of 500 crore rupees has been made under the Chief Minister Milk Producer Incentive Scheme, with 468 crore rupees already transferred through Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT). To support milk producers, a subsidy of 5 rupees per litre has been introduced, while ensuring an average price of 864 rupees per kg of fat. The Chief Minister also emphasised that farmers and animal keepers are the backbone of food and nutrition production. As part of efforts to empower them, the government has increased the ‚ÄòKisan Samman Nidhi‚Äô from 6,000 rupees to 9,000 rupees.<br/>In addition, loan facilities are being extended through the Gopal Credit Card, and more than 33,000 milk producers have been provided with 3 lakh rupees insurance coverage. The Chief Minister stated that a grant of 2,791 crore rupees has been allocated under cow protection and promotion schemes. Every registered Gaushala receives assistance of 50 rupees per cow per day and 25 rupees for small calves. Under the Nandishala Sahyogita Yojana, over 62 crore rupees have been allocated for Panchayat-level infrastructure development..</p>"
